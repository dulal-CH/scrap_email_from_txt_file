Transportation engineers formalize this idea as capacity‚Äîthe ability to move vehicles past a point over a given span of time. When the capacity of a highway section is exceeded, traffic flow breaks down, speeds drop, and vehicles crowd together. These actions cause traffic to back up behind the disruption.\\n\\nBasically, there are three types of traffic flow behavior that will cause traffic flow to break down:\\n\\n1- \"Bunching\" of vehicles as a result of reduced speed.\\n2- Intended Interruption to Traffic Flow.\\n3- Vehicle Merging Maneuvers. \\n\\nWith all this information, I believe this dog got the concept and found the solution better than me as a Highway engineer ;)\\n\\nIf you found the content informative, you may Follow me by Mehrtash Soltani, Ph.D  for more!\\n\\nVideo Credit: IG @ earthdixe\\n.......................................................................\\nAll rights and credits are reserved to the respective owner(s).
